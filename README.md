# ros2_roboclaw_driver
This is a driver for the RoboClaw family of devices for use under ROS2. 
This driver is hard coded to use a pair of motors, presumed to be in a
differential drive configuration. In various places, they are refered to
as ***m1*** and ***m2***. It is expected that ***m1*** is the left motor and ***m2*** is the right motor.

# Prerequisites
- [ROS2, Jazzy distribution](https://docs.ros.org/en/jazzy/Installation.html)
- git
  
# Build the Package From Source

It is recommented to create a new overlay workspace on top of your current ROS2 installation, although you could just clone this git repository into the src directory of an existing workspace. To create an overlay workspace:

```
mkdir -p ~/ros2_roboclaw_driver/src
cd ~/ros2_roboclaw_driver/src
git clone https://github.com/wimblerobotics/ros2_roboclaw_driver.git
cd ..
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y
colcon build --symlink-install
```

As with any ROS2 workspace overlay, you need to make the overlay known to the system. Execute the following to enable the overlay and possibly add the command to your *~/.bashrc* file so you won't forget to enable the overlay.

```
source ~/ros2_roboclaw_driver/install/local_setup.bash
```

## Notes for build
- The name ***~/ros2_roboclaw_driver*** is just an example. Create whatever workspace name you want.
- By default, a compiled version of the code with debugging symbols is created. If you don't want this, in the *CmakeLists.txt* file, remove the line
```
add_compile_options(-g)
```
- The *--symlink-install* argument is optional. It makes a build where you can change, e.g., the yaml configuration file in the workspace without having to rebuild the workspace.

# ROS topics

If the **publish_joint_states** configuration parameter is set to **true** in the configuration yaml file, the driver will publish a message on the topic **/joint_states**. The message is a standard ROS2 message of type **sensor_msgs/JointState**.

If the **publish_odom** configuration parameter is set to **true** in the configuration yaml file, the driver will publish a message on the topic **/odom**. The message is a standard ROS2 message of type **nav_msgs/Odometry**.

Both of these messages are published at 20 times per second by default but you can specify a different rate in the configuration yaml file by changing the **sensor_update_rate** parameter.

You can specify in the configuration yaml file a topic name to be used
to publish a status message for the RoboClaw device, which are mostly values pulled from various registers on the RoboClaw device. In the sample **motor_driver.yaml** file, the topic name is set to be **roboclaw_status**.
The message is a custom ROS2 message of type **ros2_roboclaw_driver/RoboClawStatus** and the specification of that message is

```
float32  m1_p
float32  m1_i
float32  m1_d
uint32  m1_qpps
int32   m1_current_speed
float32  m1_motor_current
uint32  m1_encoder_value
uint8  m1_encoder_status

float32  m2_p
float32  m2_i
float32  m2_d
uint32  m2_qpps
int32   m2_current_speed
float32  m2_motor_current
uint32  m2_encoder_value
uint8  m2_encoder_status

float32  main_battery_voltage
float32  logic_battery_voltage
float32  temperature
string  error_string
```

**NOTE** **error_string** is an English language interpretation of the status bytes of the RoboClaw. The current error interpretation may not be in agreement with the
latest RoboClaw firmware.

The error_string value is an interpretation of the RoboClaw unit status and
can include the concatenation of the following strings
- [M2 Home]
- [M1 Home]
- [Temperature2 Warning]
- [Temperature Warning]
- [Main Battery Low Warning]
- [Main Battery High Warning] 
- [M1 Driver Fault] 
- [M2 Driver Fault]
- [Logic Battery Low Error]
- [Logic Battery High Error]
- [Main Battery High Error]
- [Temperature2 Error]
- [Temperature Error]
- [E-Stop]
- [M2 OverCurrent Warning]
- [M1 OverCurrent Warning]

See the [RoboClaw User Manual](https://downloads.basicmicro.com/docs/roboclaw_user_manual.pdf) for a description of the various error codes.

There is only one topic subscribed to, **/cmd_vel**.
Messages  on **/cmd_vel** are expected to come from the naviation stack, keyboard teleop,
joystick_teleop, etc. and are the external commands to move the motors.
A continuous and frequent stream of commands is expected. 
  
When a motor movement command is issued to the RoboClaw by the driver,
the maximum possible distance of travel is computed using the commanded
velocity and the
yaml configuration parameter ***max_seconds_uncommanded_travel*** and
will be used to limit how far the robot will be allowed to travel before
another command must be issued. If commands come in less frequently than
**max_seconds_uncommanded_travel** seconds beween commands, the motors will
stop. This is a safety feature.

# Run the node
Before you run the launch file, you need to change the **/config/motor_driver.yaml** configuration file to match your hardward setup. You can use the provided launch file, which you can modify to suit your own needs, via.

# Miscellaneous notes
The driver keeps track of the encoder values for the left and right
motors. Whenever the driver starts, the existing encoder values captured
in the RoboClaw itself are reset to zero. 

This was done to decrease the probability of encoder value overflow and
underflow over a period of time, which is not dealt with especially
by this package.

Do not expect the encoder
values to be the same between node instantiations for this driver package.

# Overview of the Code

# Code Crganization
The code is organized into these directories:
- **config**: This directory contains the configuration file for the driver. It is referenced by the launch file.
- **include**: This directory contains the header files for the driver.
- **launch**: This directory contains the launch file for the driver.
- **msg**: This directory contains the custom message files for the driver.
- **src**: This directory contains the source code for the driver.
    - **motor_driver_node.cpp**: This is the main source file for the driver. This contains the **main** function and instantiates the **MotorDriver** class and then periodically samples the status of the RoboClaw device and publishes that status to a topic.
    - **motor_driver.cpp**: This is the main class for the driver. It contains the logic for communicating with the RoboClaw device and processing the commands from the ROS2 navigation stack. It deals with errors and retries. It publishes the **odom** and **joint_states** messages if configured to do so.
    - **roboclaw_driver.cpp**: This does the low-level communication with the RoboClaw. Not all RoboClaw commands are implemented, only the ones needed for this driver.
- **srv**: This directory contains the service files for the driver. Note that the service files are not used in the current version of the driver. They are provided for future use.

## Motor Control Safety and Power Shaping

There are a few safety features built into this driver. First, the angular and linear velocities are limited to a maximum value. The maximum values are set in the configuration file. The driver will clip any values exceeding these limits. The limits are governed by the **max_angular_velocity** and **max_linear_velocity** configuration values.
You should be using limits in, e.g., the ROS2 navigation stack configuration file, but this is a second line of defense.

The driver will also stop the motors if no new command is received within a certain time period. This is set in the configuration file as **max_seconds_uncommanded_travel**. The default value is 0.25 seconds. This means that if no new command is received within 0.25 seconds, the motors will be stopped. This is a safety feature to prevent the robot from running away if the navigation stack fails to send commands.

**NOTE** The following is a note for a future feature, not implemented yet.
```
The driver will also stop the motors if the current exceeds a certain value. This is set in the configuration file as **m1_max_current** and **m2_max_current**. The default value is 6.0 amps. This means that if the current exceeds 6.0 amps, the motors will be stopped. This is a safety feature to prevent the motors from overheating.
```

The driver also shapes the power provided to the motors. The velocities are ramped up and ramped down.
This prevents the motors from being commanded to go from full speed in one direction to full speed in the other direction, which can sometimes be hard on the motor windings. The acceleration ramp is controlled by the **accel_quad_pulses_per_second** value in the configuration file.

## Joint States and Odometry Publication

The driver will publish the joint states and odometry messages if configured to do so. The joint states are published on the **/joint_states** topic and the odometry is published on the **/odom** topic.
Whether or not the driver publishes these messages is controlled by the **publish_joint_states** and **publish_odom** parameters in the configuration file. The default values are **false** and **true**, respectively.

The joint states and odometry are published at a rate of 20 Hz by default and is controlled by the **sensor_update_rate** parameter in the configuration file.

## Error Handling With the RoboClaw

The driver will handle errors with the RoboClaw device, including unexpected or missing responses, failed communication, and timeouts. If an error occurs, the driver will attempt to recover from the error. The driver will retry the command a certain number of times before giving up. The number of retries is controlled by the **max_retries** parameter in the configuration file. The default value is 3.

If the low-leve I/O fails, this driver code will attempt to close the device and reopen it.

## Kinds of Devices that Can Be Used

The driver can be used with either a USB device or a UART device. The device name is the name of the device as it appears in the **/dev** directory. For example, if you are using a USB device, the device name might be **/dev/ttyUSB0**. If you are using a UART device, the device name might be **/dev/ttyAMA0** or **/dev/ttyAMA1**.
If using a USB device, the **baud_rate** parameter in the configuration file is ignored. The driver will use the default baud rate for the virtual USB device.
If using a UART device, the **baud_rate** parameter in the configuration file is used to set the baud rate for the UART device. The default value is 38400. This value must match the baud rate set on the RoboClaw device.

Various serial port options are set to achieve what, for me, has been fairly reliable communication.

## Wheel Encoder Overflow and Underflow

This code does not deal with wheel encoder overflow and underflow. On startup, the driver will reset the encoder values to zero. This is done to minimize the likelihood of overflow and underflow from causing problems with the driver. 
For my robot, which generates 1566 wheel encoder quadrature pulses per revolutions, overflow will occur after about 1,370,000 revolutions of the wheel, which with my 4 inch wheels is over 250 miles of travel.
Even allowing a velocity of a meter per second, it should take nearly 120 hours of traveling in a straight line to overflow the encoder values.


## Debugging Output

The driver will publish debugging output to the console if configured to do so. The debugging output is controlled by the **do_debug** and **do_low_level_debug** parameters in the configuration file. The default values are **false** and **false**, respectively.

Enabling the **do_debug** parameter will cause the driver to publish debugging output to the console, usually on a per-command basis, showing the  commands sent to the RoboClaw device and the responses received from the RoboClaw device.

Enabling the **do_low_level_debug** parameter will cause the driver to publish low-level debugging output to the console, usually on a byte by byte basis, showing the raw data sent to and received from the RoboClaw device. This is useful for debugging low-level communication issues.

# Using UARTs on the Raspberry Pi 5

## Enabling the UARTs

I will not accept any resposibility for damage to any device as a result of you following these instructions. This is what worked for me. Your mileage may vary and you assume all risks. Instructions for use with other Raspberry Pi devices may be similar, but I have not tested them.

***If you miswire the Raspberry Pi to the RoboClaw, you could damage the Raspberry Pi and possibly the RoboClaw. Again, you follow these instructions at  your own risk. Especially be sure that all wiring is donwe with both the Raspberry Pi and the RoboClaw completely powered off.***

There are at least two UARTs you can use with the Raspberry Pi 5. To use them, you need to add lines to the **config.txt** file via 

```bash
sudo nano /boot/firmware/config.txt
```

Of course, you can use your own favorite editor instead of **nano**.

The two UARTs are symbolically called **UART0** and **UART1**. To enable one or both, add the following to the **config.txt** file. I added these lines to the end of the file on my Raspberry Pi 5.

```code
[pi5]
dtoverlay=uart0-pi5
dtoverlay=uart1-pi5
```

The first **dtoverlay** line enables **UART0** and, as you probably guessed, the second **dtoverlay** line enables **UART1**. Put either or both of those lines after the **[pi5]** line. Understand that by putting these lines in the **config.txt** file, you are assigning a pair of pins for use as UART communication for each UART, and those pins cannot then be used for other functionality.

See [This link](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/raspberry-pi.html#gpio) for a description and description of the GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pi board.

**UART0** assigns **GPIO14** (a.k.a *TXD*) as a transmit pin and **GPIO15** (a.k.a. RXD) as a receive pin.
**UART1** assigns **GPIO0** (a.k.a. *ID_SD*) as a transmit pin and **GPIO1** (a.k.a. *ID_SC*) as a receive pin.

After you make the above change to the **config.txt** file you need to reboot the Raspberry Pi. You will see **UART0** show up in the device tree as **ttyAMA0** and **UART1** show up as **ttyAMA1**. Remember, only those devices that you enabled will show up in the device tree. E.g.

```bash
# This next line is a shell command. The resulting output is the three lines after that.
ls -l /dev/ttyAMA*
crw-rw-rw- 1 root dialout 204, 64 Mar 16 17:30 /dev/ttyAMA0
crw-rw-rw- 1 root dialout 204, 65 Mar 16 17:57 /dev/ttyAMA1
crw-rw-rw- 1 root dialout 204, 74 Mar 16 17:30 /dev/ttyAMA10
```

You can ignore the **ttyAMA10** device for purposes of this code.
## Assigning yourself to the dialout group.

By default, the devices are only able to be accessed by the **root** user or some user which is a member of the **dialout** group. In order to eliminate the complication needing to be the **root** user to use one of the UART devices, you should add yourself to the **dialout** group. First, find out your user name via:

```bash
whoami
```

The single line response will show your user name. Then you need to add that user (yourself) to the dialout group. Do it in two commands:

```bash
sudo su
usermod -a -G dialout myusername
exit
```

Replace **myusername** in the second line with the actual username result from the **whoami** command.

Adding yourself to a group won't actually take effect until you log in again. So, log out of your current Linux session and log back in again. If you execute the following command:

```bash
groups
```

you should see the list of group names that you are a member of. Obviously, **dialout** should be in that list. Now  you can access the UART(s) you enabled without needing special permission.


## Test that the UART is working.

Before connecting the Raspberry Pi to the **Roboclaw** device itself, verify that the Raspberry Pi UART is actually functional. Put a jumper between the transmit and receive pins for the UART port  you enabled. E.g., if you enabled **UART0**, put a jumper between **GPIO14** and **GPIO15**. If you enabled **UART1**, put a jumper beween **GPIO0** and **GPIO1**.

Now, simply use **minicom** (or your favorite terminal emulator) to test the UART. Issue the command:

```bash
minicom -D /dev/ttyAMA0
```

if you enabled **UART0**. For **UART1**, the device is **/dev/ttyAMA1**.

When **minicom** comes up, you should be able to type some characters on the keyboard and see them echoed in the screen. To exit **minicom**, type **control-A** followed by **Q** and then hit **Enter** when it asks if you want to "**Leave without reset?**". You can explore **minicom** if you want to play with attributes of the UART port, such as setting a different baud rate, but I'm not covering that here.

## Wiring the Raspberry Pi to the RoboClaw

When you wire the Raspberry Pi to the RoboClaw, you wire the Raspberry Pi transmit pin (i.e., **GPIO14** or **GPIO0**, whichevery you enabled) to **S1** on the RoboClaw and the Raspberry Pi receive pin (i.e., **GPIO15** or **GPIO1**) to **S2** on the RoboClaw. Make sure that there is a ground connection between the Raspberry Pi and the RoboClaw as well. You can find a ground pin to use in the row labeled '**-**' (minus) in the pins behind either **S1** or **S2**. You probably need to have motor power applied (after you have completed the wiring) to the RoboClaw as well for it to successfully talk to the Raspbery Pi 5.

## Change the motor_driver.yaml file

As described elsewhere in this document, you need to change the **motor_driver.yaml** file to point to the device you are using to communicate with the RoboClaw.
For example, here is a slice of a possible **motor_driver.yaml** file used by the launch file to use a Raspberry Pi UART. The line to change is the last line in the snippet, where you change the **device_name** parameter to point to the UART you enabled.

```yaml:

```code
motor_driver_node:
  ros__parameters:
    # Incremental acceleration to use in quadrature pulses per second.
    accel_quad_pulses_per_second: 1000

    # The device name to be opened. Change this to your actual device you are using.
    device_name: "/dev/ttyAMA1"

```
